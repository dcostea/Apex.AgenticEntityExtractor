Subject: Follow-up on Amsterdam Tech Conference 2025

Body:
Hi Elena,

It was great meeting you at the Amsterdam Tech Conference last Thursday.
I wanted to confirm our next discussion about the AI integration roadmap scheduled for November at our office.
Also, could you share the presentation slides that Dr. Michael Anders used during his keynote on optimizing distributed inference?
They would help our engineering team prepare for next week's sprint review.

Best regards,
